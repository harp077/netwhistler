<h2>MRTG Console</h2>
<p>This console* is used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>remotely add/edit/update/delete monitored network 
  devices (routers, switches, network stations) and associated network 
  interfaces; 
  
<li>remotely create daily, weekly, monthly, yearly and 
  custom-period traffic graphs and show them on the screen; 
  
<li>store these graphs in PNG files.</li>
</ul>
<p>Console has two preview panes: the left (tree) pane 
contains information about monitored network interfaces. The right (text) pane contains information about the selected element of the tree on the left side. Network devices (like routers and switches) are commonly denoted as 'Nodes'.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong> Displayed information is not constantly updated! It gets updated whenever you add, update or remove a single Node or its interface. If you want to refresh the displayed data so that it corresponds with the actual data, right click anywhere on the console or choose <em>Reload data</em> from the <em>MRTG</em> menu. However, all kind of graphs are always generated using the latest available information from the nodes.</p>

<h2>How to add a Node</h2>
<ul>
<li>From the console menu, choose <em>Node actions / Add Node...</em> New Node dialog 
  appears. 
  
<li>Supply Node address (like <em>belgrade2.eunet.yu</em> or 123.000.111.222). 
  
<li>Supply Node <em>community</em>. Communities are something like passwords 
  for SNMP access to the Node. If not sure about which community to use, ask 
  your network administrator. 
  
<li>Supply some description of the Node if necessary 
  for future reference. 
  
<li>Checkbox <em>Active</em> should 
  be already checked by default. 
  
<li>Click OK. Newly defined Node appears on the left side of the screen.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to add a network interface</h2>
<ul>
<li>Select the Node with the desired interface in the 
  tree pane. 
  
<li>From the menu, choose <em>Interface actions / Add interface... </em>New interface 
  dialog appears. 
  
<li>Select the desired interface from the list of all 
  available interfaces on the Node. 
  
<li>Specify description if necessary for future 
  reference. 
  
<li>Specify sampling interval in seconds. It represents 
  the amount of time that should pass before the console checks the 
  traffic load for the specific interface on the Node once again. Valid values 
  are between 10 seconds and 600 seconds (10 minutes). 
  
<li>Checkbox <em>Active</em> should 
  be already checked by default. 
  
<li>Click OK.</li>
</ul>
<p>Newly defined interface appears on the left side of the screen, probably with [-1] number added to its name. It means that MRTG console still does not know the real number of the interface on the Node. But if you reload data  a few seconds later, you will probably see some positive number instead of [-1]. It means that the new interface exists on the Node. You can be sure that the traffic monitoring process has started successfully.</p>
<h2>How to create traffic graphs </h2>
<ul>
<li>Select network interface you want to create graph 
  for. 
  
<li>Chose the desired graph type from the <em>Interface actions </em>menu. The following graphs can be 
  created with a single click: daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, last 24 hours and 
  custom-period graphs. The graph appears in the new frame. 
  
<li>Click on the <em>Save</em> button to the right of the graph to save it in a PNG file format.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Graphs starting in the past and ending in the future 
  (graph for the current day, week, month and year, for example) are 
  automatically refreshed each 5 minutes. You can watch the growth of your 
  current daily graph - LIVE. 
<li>You can open as many graph frames as you wish. All 
  graphs will be updated simultaneously, if necessary. 
  
<li>Use custom graphs to create traffic graphs for arbitrary time intervals.</li>
</ul>
